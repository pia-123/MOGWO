# MOGWO
The primary objective of this project is to enhance the accuracy of a Decision Tree classifier by selecting the most relevant features from the dataset using the GWO algorithm. This process aims to reduce the dimensionality of the data, improve model performance, and provide insights into the importance of different features.
